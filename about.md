### Background

I used to be a research analyst. I would analyse a company - looking at it's business strategy, competitive position and advantages, key drivers, industry analysis then investigating its financials which involved modelling historical data and developing forecasts & valuations. 

I'd also have to use a lot of data, so I began getting into Excel VBA and coding because it automated a lot of menial, repetitive tasks.


### Move to Tech

I wanted to work for startups and tech companies. I had spent a lot of time researching them and realised their ability to transform industries in short spaces of time that other traditional companies simply could not do.
