title: How a research analyst background helps in growth
---

As a research analyst, I spent **A LOT** of time reading. Company announcements like annual reports, articles on economics, industry journals, investment ideas, books on analysing financials & companies.

You could never sit still as an analyst. Information for finance will never sit and wait, it may slow, but it wont stop. You could also never assume you got your company picks correct. You need to look at it subjectively, run different assumptions & scenarios and try to determine a reasonable confidence.

I think this is the same with Growth. You can launch a campaign, but that doesn't mean it's over. 

In fact Growth shares many similarities with Finance. Many of the processes and frameworks that some of the noted names talk about, (Sean Ellis, Brian Balfour, Gabriel Weinberg, Morgan Brown, Andrew Chen etc) are similar to those that a research analyst uses. Many parts of the processes & frameworks, like A/B testing and iteration have the same foundations as to how they're used in finance.

### Processes & Frameworks

This gets me to a point where I think the 2 worlds really do align. Without processes to analyse a company or the risk of a portfolio in finance, you're just shooting in the dark. You're pulling information up randomly and expecting a good outcome. Garbage in, garbage out.

This was me when I first tried looking at growth for my [startup] (https://study101.com/). I started looking at basic articles with catchy headlines. 

What I very quickly realised is that they were exactly that, "8 things to growth" BS. After buying some books and following some well respected growth guys, you understand that it involves a methodology and a set of processes to succeed over time. "Viral" & "Hacks" are [catchy titles] (https://conversionxl.com/blog/growth-hacking/) for articles but it's best to avoid these because they're unlikely to have any substance. 

**It also pays to think independently.**

Case studies are written in both Growth & Finance with plenty of detail and information about a particular company or method. Now if your company isn't exactly the same, does that mean the information doesn't apply? **NO** It means that you have to look at it slightly differently, perhaps the medium or method is a little different, but there's information for you to explore and work on.

If it's on B2B, should it be ignored if you work in B2C? 

**No way**

Pick it apart a little and you will see that you can use parts of it that can sit in your world.
