title: How a research analyst background helps in Growth
---

As a research analyst, I spent **A LOT** of time reading. Company announcements like annual reports, articles on economics, industry journals, investment ideas, books on analysing financials & companies.

You could never sit still as an analyst. Information for finance will never sit and wait, it may slow, but it wont stop. You could also never assume you got your company picks correct. You need to look at it subjectively, run different assumptions & scenarios and try to determine a reasonable confidence.

I think this is the same with Growth. You can launch a campaign, but that doesn't mean it's over. 

In fact Growth shares many similarities with Finance. Many of the processes and frameworks that some of the noted names talk about, (Sean Ellis, Brian Balfour, Gabriel Weinberg, Morgan Brown, Andrew Chen etc) are similar to those that a research analyst uses. Likewise, many of the tools (like A/B testing) have the same foundations as to how and when they're used in finance and they both likely come from scientific research.

### Processes & Frameworks

Without structure or processes to analyse a company or the risk of a portfolio in finance, you're just shooting in the dark. You're pulling information up randomly and expecting a good outcome.

This was me when I first tried looking at growth for my [startup](https://study101.com/). I was looking at basic articles with catchy headlines. 

What I very quickly realised is that there were catchy headlines with BS substance when you search in google. After buying some key books and following some well respected growth guys, you understand that it involves a methodology and a set of processes to succeed over time. "Viral" & "Hacks" are [catchy titles](https://conversionxl.com/blog/growth-hacking/) for articles but it's best to avoid these because they're unlikely to have any substance or be repeatable. 


#### It pays to think independently.

Believe it or not, as a research analyst I had to try and think differently to everyone else. I didn't want to look into details about the latest market darling, I needed to try and find one without the spotlight.

It's worth reading about information that is outside of the scope of your area. Case studies are written in both Growth & Finance with plenty of detail and information about a particular company, industry or method. Now, if your company isn't exactly the same as the case study, does that mean the information doesn't apply? **NO** It means that you have to look at it slightly differently, but know that there's information for you to explore, reflect about and possibly use in the future.

If it's on B2B, should it be ignored if you work in B2C? 

**No way**

Pick it apart a little and you will see that you can use parts of it that can sit in your world. In finance, I used to keep a "Bible" of references, frameworks, resources & even quotes that I'd refer to for each industry. They were basically cheat sheets. I've also done the same with Growth, with a spreadsheet broken into the different areas (content, conversion, testing, Paid Social, GAds, Seo, etc) and frequently add to them with new articles & case studies. I read with the intention of learning, not copying and trying to find something to file away for another day.


### Analysing Data

[Lean Analytics](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Analytics-Better-Startup-Faster/dp/1449335675) addresses this perfectly and is well worth the read if you're unsure what you should be measuring or looking at for a given industry. 

Getting hung up on high level or the wrong data & analytics without digging into the real ones is dangerous. 

It can be difficult to highlight the importance if everyone is going at 100%, but if others don't understand the impacts can be costly.

**North Star** - If you're really _data driven_ you should identify the most important metric for your current stage, the one the product/service delivers to customers. Once settled, you should constantly learn about and optimize for that metric.
