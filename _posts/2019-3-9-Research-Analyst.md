title: How a research analyst helps in growth

As a research analyst, I spent **A LOT** of time reading. Company announcements like annual reports, articles on economics, industry journals, investment ideas, books on analysing financials & companies.

**It also pays to think independently.**

Case studies are written in both Growth & Finance with plenty of detail and information about a particular company or method.
