_Reverse engineering_, also called back engineering, is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object; similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is about a natural phenomenon.

Reverse engineering processes from tech companies that lead the way in growth and conversion is a little hobby of mine when I get some spare time. 

I've been reverse engineering things for years. With my role as an analyst I did it A LOT (I figured out how much fuel Qantas was going to use in a year), it's also very helpful when you're learning to program / code.

**Why?**

As a startup, you can't always the time or resources to reinvent the wheel. If someone else has spent a lot of time fine tuning a process in the real world, then why start from scratch? This is a great place to start.

I did it with politics during an election campaign. Instead of looking at other Australia politicians (which are very old school & average), I looked at candidates for the US mid-term elections. These guys have BIG budgets and lead the charge with their approach (albeit quite aggressively). They provided plenty of inspiration for website design & optimisation (particularly CTA), email and page messaging as well as Thank you pages.

My love of Thank you pages has seriously grown since focussing on them during the election. We were able to get users through our funnel via the Thank you pages. We saw high conversion days where they were in the top 3-5 paths for users which is absolutely crazy. Low and behold, after some basic changes to key areas, signup conversions increased 20%.

We also added in plenty of nice little incentives along the way. A volunteer counter with a goal (like change.org), breaking our donation form into 3 steps and selecting $100 as the 'selected' amount - which saw our average donation increase.

I've worked a little bit with eCommerce and done plenty of research in this area so I've found it really fascinating to test out solid existing eCommerce companies (with good backing & budgets) to help understand their roadmap.

Here are some steps to pick apart their process:
* Look at their home page. What information are they including? What questions from customers are they answering? What social proof are they using and again which messages are they highlighting.
* Keep your consumer hat on and don't look up the careers page. They might be removing you from their interested users list.
* Look at other main pages (eg products/services, pricing, etc) and repeat the process in the first point
* Look at blog posts and see if they use tags
* If it's eCommerce, do they use pop ups with discounts or exit intent on pages? Do the product pages have 'similar' or 'complete the look' items? Add an item to your cart and check out - do they upsell anything - do they use any messaging around safe and secure payments? There's plenty more to look at here.
* Check out Wappalyzer to see if it picks up some of the software they use - you often see analytics, dev frameworks, Shopify, Magneto and on some pages their CRM;
* Log onto FB and start scrolling down your main feed. Also, check out some high traffic news sites and see whether you get retargeted. Screen shot the ad and think about their messaging - your in their funnel.
* Look at their FB page and go to their Ads library, then click through to their landing pages - you can access a companies library of ads which is so interesting and awesome! Try to categorise which ads might be getting shown to which stage of the funnel. For plenty of companies, you will see many repeated ads.
* Go back onto their site and sign up to their newsletter/service/trial. Check out their email automation. You'll pick up a lot of ideas from their email funnel so you can sit back. After a few days, click and engage a bit further (email or back on the website) - particularly if it's eCommerce - add something to your cart and then bounce. You might find you're remarketed/retargeted.
* If you really want to dial it up, check out WASP.inspector and check out some of the triggers/tags and analytics they're running on their page.
* Repeat the same process in incognito as a mobile device (CMD + Option + J then hit the mobile/tablet icon).

There are some big statistics about users who visit on one device (mobile) that purchase on another (desktop), so you may want to actually visit on a mobile first, then revisit on a desktop later.

Having a developer background you may think that I'm a little too biased with Websites and conversions, and yes, I do love UX but I know this is ground zero and it's where small incremental improvements can see the greatest results and impact to growth and a business.

In my old research world, when reengineering a process to analyse a company, you'd focus on the major drivers of revenue & earnings. Why focuss on an area which has 5% impact?
